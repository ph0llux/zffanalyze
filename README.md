# Installation

First, you need to [install rust and cargo](https://rustup.rs/) to build or install ```zffmetareader```.
Then you can easily build this tool yourself by using cargo:
```bash
[/home/ph0llux/projects/zffmetareader] $ cargo build --release
```
Or you can install the tool directly from crates.io:
```bash
$ cargo install zffmetareader
```

# Planned features until zffmetareader reaches version 1.0
- handling encrypted header information
